#Read in data

```{r}
#where is your file saved?
andreas_filepath <- 'C:\\Users\\drey\\Desktop\\School\\DataViz\\DataSets\\makeovermonday.csv'
suyin_filepath <- ''

current_user_filepath <- andreas_filepath

MM <- read_csv(current_user_filepath)
head(MM)
#I don't like the spaces in these columns, will rename:
MM %>% rename(TravelTime = 'Raw travel time') -> MM
MM %>% rename(TicketPrice = 'Ticket price') -> MM
```

#Descriptive Stats

```{r}
#Let's see what we are dealing with:

#Any missings?
sum(is.na(MM)) #0, so there are no NAs

MM %>%
  group_by(Route) %>%
  summarize(city_tuple = n_distinct(Route)) #6, just like in the graph.

#Mode should always have 6 plane, 6 train for each city tuple:
MM %>%
  group_by(Route,Mode) %>%
  summarize(city_tuple = n()) #It does.

#Summaries for the cost variables
#Note that Eco Cost & Raw travel time are always the same w/in each city/Mode dyad
MM %>% 
  group_by(Route,Mode) %>%
  summarize(CO2_Produced = first(EcoPassengerCO2),
            Time_Spent = first(TravelTime),
            Price_Min = min(TicketPrice),
            Price_Max = max(TicketPrice),
            Price_Med = quantile(TicketPrice,names = FALSE,probs=0.5),
            Price_Avg = mean(TicketPrice),
            Price_StD = sd(TicketPrice))
```

#Visualizing some of the data

```{r}
#Easier to look at than the table above.
ggplot(MM) + geom_line(aes(-WeeksAhead,TicketPrice,color=Route,linetype=Mode))
```
